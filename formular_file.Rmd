The linear mixed effects model with a random intercept for each individual and slope on time since ART initiation can be represented numerically as:

$$Y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot Time_{ij} + u_{0i} + u_{1i} \cdot Time_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}$$

where:

* $Y_{ij}$ is the response variable for individual $i$ at time $j$
* $\beta_0$ is the fixed effect intercept
* $\beta_1$ is the fixed effect slope for time since ART initiation
* $u_{0i}$ is the random intercept for individual $i$
* $u_{1i}$ is the random slope for individual $i$
* $\epsilon_{ij}$ is the residual error for individual $i$ at time $j$
* $Time_{ij}$ is the time since ART initiation for individual $i$ at time $j$
